## People Following RC-Car 

- Created on Jetson TX-2 with Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic.
- Camera used was a ZED Stereo Camera.

Person detection was developed using YOLO which uses a neural network to detect objects and tracking of person was maintained 
using the Mean Shift Algorithm with the Bhattacharrya Distance. 

RC Car motor was controlled using an arduino which was controlled depending on the depth and position of the tracked person.
